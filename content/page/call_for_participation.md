The volume of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has grown dramatically in the past decade due to
the wide adoption of EHR systems in health care systems. The availability of such large amounts of
multi modality clinical data has fostered the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
clinical care, for example, clinical decision support, patient management, as well as in clinical
and translational research, such as digital phenotyping, cohort discovery, and in-silico trials.
Despite the promising potential of AI in clinical applications, its regular use comes with bias and
ethical challenges. As highlighted by recent studies, disparities in health care, although may start
at the collection of clinical data, could be amplified with the development of AI technologies.
