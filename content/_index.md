**Talk Title**: Towards Building Trustworthy Machine Learning Models in Medicine: Accuracy,
Fairness, Explainability, and All That

**Abstract**: Machine learning (ML) is playing a more and more important role in medicine. One of
the main reasons that ML models caught lots of attention is their superior quantitative performance.
Recent research and practice pointed out that we also need to consider other aspects, such as model
fairness and explainability. There exist tradeoffs among those different indices, so it is
challenging to achieve all of them simultaneously. In this presentation, I will discuss the
relationships among these different indices, introduce some of our work on joint optimization of
multiple of them, and talk about future directions.

**Bio**: Fei Wang is an Associate Professor in Division of Health Informatics, Department of
Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), Cornell University. He is also the
founding director of the WCM institute of AI for Digital Health (AIDH). His major research interest
is AI and digital health. He has published more than 300 papers on the top venues of related areas
such as ICML, KDD, NIPS, CVPR, AAAI, IJCAI, Nature Medicine, JAMA Internal Medicine, Annals of
Internal Medicine, Lancet Digital Health, etc. His papers have received over 24,000 citations so far
with an H-index 76. His (or his students’) papers have won 8 best paper (or nomination) awards at
top international conferences on data mining and medical informatics. His team won the championship
of the AACC PTHrP result prediction challenge in 2022, NIPS/Kaggle Challenge on Classification of

Characterization of Stigmatizing Language in Medical Records

**Abstract**: Widespread disparities in clinical outcomes exist between different demographic groups
in the United States. A new line of work in medical sociology has demonstrated physicians often use
stigmatizing language in electronic medical records within certain groups, such as black patients,
which may exacerbate disparities. In this study, we characterize these instances at scale using a
series of domain-informed NLP techniques. We highlight important differences between this task and
analogous bias-related tasks studied within the NLP community (e.g., classifying microaggressions).
Our study establishes a foundation for NLP researchers to contribute timely insights to a problem
domain brought to the forefront by recent legislation regarding clinical documentation transparency.
We release data, code, and models.

**Bio**: Keith Harrigian is a 4th year PhD Student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University.
With his advisor Mark Dredze, Keith researches computational and statistical methods for modeling
natural language. He is particularly interested in developing robust and stable machine learning
models for application in the healthcare domain. Prior to joining Johns Hopkins, Keith was a Senior
Quantitative Analyst at Warner Media where he leveraged machine learning and natural language
processing to mine social media data for applications to film and television marketing. He holds a
M.S.E in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University and a B.S. in Mathematics with minors in
Physics and Music from Northeastern University. He is currently on leave from JHU, working as a
machine learning intern at Netflix.

### Call for Papers / Participation

---

The volume of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has grown dramatically in the past decade due to
the wide adoption of EHR systems in healthcare systems. The availability of large amounts of
multimodal clinical data has fostered the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in clinical
care including in clinical decision support, patient management, as well as in clinical and
translational research, such as digital phenotyping, cohort discovery, and in-silico trials. Despite
the promising potential of AI in clinical applications, its regular use comes with bias and ethical
challenges. As highlighted by recent studies, disparities in health care, although may start at the
collection of clinical data, could be amplified with the development of AI technologies.

### Topics of interest

---

Any original research related to ethics and bias of AI in clinical applications. The relevant AI
techniques include, but are not limited to, natural language processing, medical imaging, deep
learning, predictive modeling, human computer interface, Internet of Things, and more. Clinical
applications include, but are not limited to, clinical decision support, clinical research,
translational research, consumer applications, robotics.

Other relevant topics include: AI for health equity, AI for health disparity,
transparency/interpretability/explainability of AI techniques in clinical applications, data bias,
algorithmic bias, human bias of AI techniques, fairness metrics, fairness evaluation, fairness
tools, reasoning, practical and technical solutions to mitigate the bias, and more.

Finally, we will consider limited types of position papers on AI ethics/bias. This would include
position papers from individuals/groups that are part of a community that has historically been
adversely impacted by artificial intelligence, bias, or health disparities. We will also consider
position papers from institutions playing key roles in mitigating the impact of bias in clinical
applications.
