### Call for Participation

---

The volume of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has grown dramatically in the past decade due to
the wide adoption of EHR systems in healthcare systems. The availability of large amounts of
multimodal clinical data has fostered the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in clinical
care including in clinical decision support, patient management, as well as in clinical and
translational research, such as digital phenotyping, cohort discovery, and in-silico trials. Despite
the promising potential of AI in clinical applications, its regular use comes with bias and ethical
challenges. As highlighted by recent studies, disparities in health care, although may start at the
collection of clinical data, could be amplified with the development of AI technologies.

### Topics of interest

---

Any original research related to ethics and bias of AI in clinical applications. The relevant AI
techniques include, but are not limited to, natural language processing, medical imaging, deep
learning, predictive modeling, human computer interface, Internet of Things, and more. Clinical
applications include, but are not limited to, clinical decision support, clinical research,
translational research, consumer applications, robotics.

Other relevant topics include: AI for health equity, AI for health disparity,
transparency/interpretability/explainability of AI techniques in clinical applications, data bias,
algorithmic bias, human bias of AI techniques, fairness metrics, fairness evaluation, fairness
tools, reasoning, practical and technical solutions to mitigate the bias, and more.
