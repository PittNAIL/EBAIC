### Workshop Topic Description

---

The volume of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has grown dramatically in the past decade due to
the wide adoption of EHR systems in health care systems. The availability of such large amounts of
multi modality clinical data has fostered the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
clinical care, for example, clinical decision support, patient management, as well as in clinical
and translational research, such as digital phenotyping, cohort discovery, and in-silico trials.
Despite the promising potential of AI in clinical applications, its regular use comes with bias and
ethical challenges. As highlighted by recent studies, disparities in health care, although may start
at the collection of clinical data, could be amplified with the development of AI technologies. This
workshop will provide a unique platform to share the state-of-the-art research, methodologies, and
tools to tackle the ethical and bias challenges of AI techniques when applied in clinical
applications. The venue will also facilitate interactions among students, researchers, physicians,
health IT professionals in health informatics who are interested in AI in clinical applications. The
workshop will invite papers and short abstracts on novel approaches, works in progress, comparative
analyses of tools, and original state-of-the-art work in ethics and bias of AI techniques in
clinical applications. Selected papers will be presented as podium talks, and other interesting
submissions and abstracts will be showcased as poster presentations. In addition, we will organize
an educational event, the Ethics and Bias of Clinical AI Applications Hackathon, which uses hands-on
algorithm examples and real-world health data to help the researchers and students understand the
bias in big data and AI techniques in health care. We will focus on two tasks: clinical natural
language processing and medical imaging. The event will be available for all students and
researchers and specifically targeted at the students at the intersection of computer science,
informatics, and health sciences at the conference.

### Audience

---

Target audience includes students, researchers, physicians, health IT professionals in health
informatics. Anyone interested in the ethics and bias challenges of AI techniques in clinical
applications is welcome. Researchers and students working on clinical AI projects and others
interested in learning about and sharing experience in addressing ethical challenges when applying
AI in real world products are strongly encouraged to attend. We also welcome students who wish to
closely interact with health informatics experts. Potential attendees may come from machine
learning, NLP, and medical imaging communities in the medical domain (e.g., AMIA), as well as
general health informatics professionals and researchers (e.g., ACL, IEEE). The anticipated number
of attendees is around 50.

### Publicity

---

To attract attendees, we will advertise the workshop widely, including:

1. Sending emails using community mailing lists such as AMIA Working Group mailing list.
2. Creating a dedicated web site for the workshop.
3. Contacting individuals through personal connections of organizers and committee members.
4. Leveraging social media such as LinkedIn and Twitter.
5. Contacting training programs in computer science, information science, and biomedical informatics
   to attract additional students and trainees.

### Workshop Structure

---

This will be a one-day workshop (6 hours). We will allocate about 1 hour for an invited keynote
presentation, 2 hours of podium talks of accepted papers, 1 hour for poster presentations of
accepted abstracts, and 2 hours for the Ethics and Bias of Clinical AI Applications Hackathon.

### Reviewing

---

We will accept both full paper and poster submissions of original research in addressing ethics and
bias of AI techniques in clinical applications. All submissions will be submitted and handled
through EasyChair. A program committee (PC) will be formed consisting of members from the steering
committee and other researchers with experience in health informatics. All submitted papers will
undergo a peer review process conducted by at least 2 reviewers from the PC. All accepted
submissions will be presented at the workshop and published in the IEEE ICHI 2023 Proceedings
(including being archived in IEEE Xplore Digital Library). We also propose to invite selected papers
to publish an extended version of their work in a special issue of Journal of American Medical
Informatics Association or Journal of Medical Internet Research. (We will start negotiating with the
journal after proposal acceptance).

### Topics of Interest

---

Any original research related to ethics and bias of AI in clinical applications. The relevant AI
techniques include, but not limited to, natural language processing, medical imaging, deep learning,
predictive modeling, human computer interface, Internet of Things, and more. Clinical applications
include, but not limited to, clinical decision support, clinical research, translational research,
consumer applications, robotics. Other relevant topics include: AI for health equities, health
disparities, transparency/interpretability/explainability of AI techniques in clinical applications,
data bias, algorithmic bias, human bias of AI techniques, fairness measures, fairness evaluations,
fairness tools, reasoning, practical and technical solutions to mitigate the bias, and more.

### Submission and Review

---

Anyone who is interested in ethics and bias of AI in clinical applications is invited to submit his
or her work to the EBAIC 2023. We accept both full paper submissions (6 pages) and poster
submissions (4 pages). All papers will be submitted and handled through EasyChair at xxxx, with peer
review by domain experts.
