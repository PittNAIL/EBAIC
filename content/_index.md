### Agenda

### Call for Papers / Participation

---

The volume of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has grown dramatically in the past decade due to
the wide adoption of EHR systems in healthcare systems. The availability of large amounts of
multimodal clinical data has fostered the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in clinical
care including in clinical decision support, patient management, as well as in clinical and
translational research, such as digital phenotyping, cohort discovery, and in-silico trials. Despite
the promising potential of AI in clinical applications, its regular use comes with bias and ethical
challenges. As highlighted by recent studies, disparities in health care, although may start at the
collection of clinical data, could be amplified with the development of AI technologies.

### Topics of interest

---

Any original research related to ethics and bias of AI in clinical applications. The relevant AI
techniques include, but are not limited to, natural language processing, medical imaging, deep
learning, predictive modeling, human computer interface, Internet of Things, and more. Clinical
applications include, but are not limited to, clinical decision support, clinical research,
translational research, consumer applications, robotics.

Other relevant topics include: AI for health equity, AI for health disparity,
transparency/interpretability/explainability of AI techniques in clinical applications, data bias,
algorithmic bias, human bias of AI techniques, fairness metrics, fairness evaluation, fairness
tools, reasoning, practical and technical solutions to mitigate the bias, and more.

Finally, we will consider limited types of position papers on AI ethics/bias. This would include
position papers from individuals/groups that are part of a community that has historically been
adversely impacted by artificial intelligence, bias, or health disparities. We will also consider
position papers from institutions playing key roles in mitigating the impact of bias in clinical
applications.

#### Scientific Session

- Keynote Talk
  - [Fei Wang][drfeiwang], PhD, FACMI, FAMIA, FIAHSI, ACM Distinguished Member.  
    Associate Professor of Health Informatics, Weill Cornell Medicine. Founding Director. WCM
    Institute of AI for Digital Health.
- Oral Presentations & Posters
  - Submission Types:
    - **Regular Papers**: 10 pages with up to 2 extra pages for references/appendices.
      - Will describe mature ideas, where a substantial amount of implementation, experimentation,
        or data collection and analysis has been completed.
    - **Short Papers**: 6 pages with up to 1 extra page for references/appendices.
      - Will describe innovative ideas, where preliminary implementation and validation work have
        been conducted.
    - **Poster Submissions**: 2 pages with up to 1 extra page for references/appendices.
      - Will present innovative ideas, late-breaking work, concepts, work-in-progress, early stages
        of research, and preliminary results from implementation and validations to academic and
        industrial audience.
    - **Position Papers**: 4 pages with up to 2 extra pages for references/appendices.
      - Will present an arguable opinion about AI ethics/bias and its impact.

#### Tutorial/Hackathon Session

The purpose of the tutorial/hackathon session is to raise awareness of the problem of bias in
clinical data and AI algorithms with the ultimate goal of creating innovative approaches that can
help reduce or eliminate bias in clinical data and AI. Participants may be students, researchers,
and data scientists who are interested in applying AI to clinical applications. Complete this [form][form] to register the Tutorial/Hackathon Session.

- Track I: Clinical Natural Language Processing
  - Data: de-identified clinical notes from MIMIC III
  - Algorithm: Rule-based NLP algorithm
  - Task: Understand how stigmatizing language in clinical notes varies by patients' medical
    condition and race/ethnicity
  - Pre-requisite: Complete required training and sign the data use agreement for the MIMIC III data
    access at [https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/][mimicdatause]
- Track II: Medical Imaging
  - Data: Knee X-ray images from NIH OAI publicly available dataset
  - Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Task: Understand how knee joint segmentation and measurement varies by different racial or
    gender groups, and imbalanced training data

### Submission and Review

---

Anyone who is interested in ethics and bias of AI in clinical applications is invited to submit
their work to the EBAIC 2023.

Authors can log in at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeeichi2023][submit] and submit
their papers under the "ebaic" track. All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by domain experts.

Accepted papers will also be invited to publish an extended version in the [Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research][jhir] with an accelerated peer-review process and a free of charge for publication (except Open Access).

### More Information

---

For more information regarding paper template and review process, please visit
